    'id': HOROSCOPE_ARIES,
    CATEGORY_GENERAL: 'Today you might host a gathering of people interested in psychic or metaphysical matters, Aries. A very special guest could give a talk or lead a discussion group. This could be fascinating for everyone present. You\'ll gain a reputation as a wonderful host, even though all you really do is pass out cookies and pour the coffee. You, above all, should have a great time and enjoy talking with your friends. Have fun!',
    CATEGORY_CAREER : 'There is an important task that you need to finish today. Don\'t gloss over this detail. Your first reaction may be to dismiss it under the premise that you have "more important things to do". Honestly take a look at what your priorities should be.',
    CATEGORY_LOVE : 'If a certain relationship seems to be just out of your grasp, or difficult to initiate, then you may find it helpful to cast aside certain doubts. The planetary alignment gives you the strength and determination to make your mark, and also to explain just how you feel. If you summon real confidence, you will begin to see quite a difference in how the object of your affections responds to you.',
    CATEGORY_HEALTH : 'Today\'s energy has a great personal impact. The deeper you go to find your truth, the brighter you will shine. There is a tendency for you to be somewhat afraid of risk, to appear selfish and stubborn to others because of a fear of the unknown. Give yourself the permission to explore yourself without fear. Treat yourself to a deep tissue massage - the journey of relaxation and free association could be a gentle way to unlock what\'s inside, just waiting to get out and enrich your life.',
    CATEGORY_FINANCIAL : 'All good things come to those who wait, but you don\'t have to wait long for the good stuff. Aspects affect your house of past lives, karma, and institutions, so you\'re receiving all kinds of valuable information from your dreams and psychic flashes. Make sure to pay attention. You may second-guess yourself too much. Starting this week, trust yourself to achieve all you want.',

  {
    'id': HOROSCOPE_TAURUS,
    CATEGORY_GENERAL: 'Writing may be one of your main focuses for today, Taurus. You have a lot of information to impart to anyone who might be interested in what you have to say. You could try your hand at a magazine article or perhaps fiction or poetry. However, even if all you write at this time is a letter to your cousin, what you say will undoubtedly be bright, gripping, and certainly very interesting. Go to it!',
    CATEGORY_CAREER : 'A new opportunity will come your way today. Be on the lookout for this new developmental phase. Even though this opportunity may seem small now, it has the potential to grow into something bigger and more prosperous in the future. Keep your eyes open.',
    CATEGORY_LOVE : 'The planetary alignment gives you an opportunity to push a certain relationship into deeper waters. Not that you are overly passionate - you tend to prefer to talk about these things in a low-key way, rather than get too deeply involved. Yet even you cannot deny that you would very much like a particular person to be more closely linked to you. If you play your cards right, they will be.',
    CATEGORY_HEALTH : 'You are impressionable and easily stimulated. With today\'s planetary energy, you are apt to succumb to sensual impulses that aren\'t always in your best interests: staying up late eating ice cream is one way to conjure up what I\'m talking about! The cosmic climate adds to the dreamy lack of boundaries that is at once seductive and also trouble inducing. Enjoy yourself, but don\'t give up on your commitments - if you can still make it to the gym three times a week you\'re not a total goner!',
    CATEGORY_FINANCIAL : 'This week is about the aspects affecting your house of debt and other people\'s money. Your career is affecting this house as well. However, you may be tested in the area of your friends or other groups. They\'re simply unstable now and may be great one day but completely unsupportive the next. Go it alone for now until you can find folks you can trust.',

  {
    'id': HOROSCOPE_GEMINI,
    CATEGORY_GENERAL: 'Professional interests continue to expand, Gemini, and you\'re managing to keep very busy. Your income is rising, and you could be achieving a certain prominence in your field. Nonetheless, you could be looking for new opportunities. The field you\'re in now may not be one that you want to continue for the next 20 years. This is therefore a good day to put out a few feelers and test the waters. You might be surprised at the opportunities out there.',
    CATEGORY_CAREER : 'It will be hard for you to stay focused on the tasks at hand today. Your mind is likely to feel quite scattered. Don\t push yourself to finish anything big or you may get frustrated that you have bitten off more than you can chew.',
    CATEGORY_LOVE : 'You want passion, but will perhaps be a bit suspicious about the quality of romance served up today. The planetary alignment offers a chance to get to know someone more deeply, but for you there is still that all-important emotional harmony missing. The very obvious intellectual compatibility doesn\'t quite make up for this, either, at least not in your book. You\'ll need to either change your priorities or forget it.',
    CATEGORY_HEALTH : 'The tendency to nurture others can be a liability for you. Unless you are a paid professional during office hours, taking care of yourself first is your foremost responsibility. Even parents need to focus on themselves if they are going to be proper role models for their children. If you need someone to nurture, look in the mirror! You are a wonderful listener: ask your reflection what it needs, and hop to it! It may take a little practice, but you can do it.',
    CATEGORY_FINANCIAL : 'This week look to your money and values. It\'s very important not to just earn money as fast as you spend it or vice versa. This time should be about making a concerted change to your long-term financial future. Your career sector is affected, too, which means that you need to save for a time when your company may not be as stable as it is now.',

    'id': HOROSCOPE_CANCER,
    CATEGORY_GENERAL: 'Travel in the company of a close companion might be looming over the horizon, Cancer. In fact, you might be leaving pretty soon, and you\'re probably growing excited. Some surprising developments could come up during the course of this journey, and thus it\'s likely to shape up to be more than a simple vacation. Make sure you look your best, don\'t hold back on what you want to do, and have fun.',
    CATEGORY_CAREER : 'You may catch yourself daydreaming instead of working today, but this is fine. The truth is that you are likely to find more answers in your daydreams than you will find in reality. Don\'t be afraid to stare into the clouds for the solutions you seek.',
    CATEGORY_LOVE : 'Today\'s planetary alignment could bring out the best in you. If you are dating or even just interested in a certain special person, make sure to wear your most flattering outfit today. This is one time when putting a bit of extra effort into your appearance will pay off and help you have more luck in love. And as you are a great catch, how can you fail?',
    CATEGORY_HEALTH : 'Today\'s atmosphere helps you express your emotional side. With so much attention being paid to your energetic personality, it can sometimes be a challenge to make yourself vulnerable and really know what you are feeling. Movement that challenges you to be physically vulnerable is a recommended practice for emotional release. Yoga, of course, and stretching out the chest cavity in particular. Applying a hot water bottle to your chest at night is another way to bring gentle attention to your emotional core.',
    CATEGORY_FINANCIAL : 'You still have restrictive aspects slowing down your house of money, which may be frustrating at times. But you\'re also being given some new marching orders. Most affected is your day job, which is undergoing a huge change. You may even change careers or the way you bring in cash on a regular basis. Watch your health, which could become run down as a result of stress. It\'s better to be safe than sorry.',

    'id': HOROSCOPE_LEO,
    CATEGORY_GENERAL: 'An unexpected lucky break could come your way today, Leo - something you would never have expected in a hundred years. It could seem like a dream come true, yet it could disrupt your life in some way. You might find yourself facing a choice: go for it and change your entire way of life or let it go and take the risk that another great opportunity might never appear. Who said life was easy? Think about it!',
    CATEGORY_CAREER : 'Other people\'s indecisiveness may hold you back today. You are waiting to hear from someone else before you can make your next big move. Don\'t worry about it. You are better off waiting until you get this information instead of moving ahead.',
    CATEGORY_LOVE : 'Once again the cosmos calls you to put on your hottest clothes and prepare for an evening of entertainment. The planetary alignment gives you that extra determination and courage to take an extraordinarily bold step, one that you would normally shy away from. But on this occasion you will have the sense to realize just how much is at stake if you choose to stay at home instead.',
    CATEGORY_HEALTH : 'Today, give yourself more than enough time to do the most mundane things. Being rushed by others is also not something you will react well to. One of the best ways to escape the expectations of others is to set your limits and stick to them like crazy. Give yourself an extra hour at the gym, try some new form of a workout in addition to your regular routine. I do not mean that you should push yourself too far, but you have the extra energy today, and it\'s best that you use it for your own purposes, not someone else\'s.',
    CATEGORY_FINANCIAL : 'The Universe is making you incredibly creative now. You may be filled with ideas for how to make more money, invest it, and use it to better your life. Aspects affect your house of debt and other people\'s money. Be prepared for the best and the worst here, and pay off what you can.',

  {
    'id': HOROSCOPE_VIRGO,
    CATEGORY_GENERAL: 'If you aren\'t currently romantically involved, Virgo, today you could meet someone who shows a lot of promise. Work might be involved in some way, and it\'s also possible that this person has been living in your neighborhood for a long time. A friend could introduce you to each other. You\'ll probably spend at least an hour talking, and will probably make arrangements to meet again.',
    CATEGORY_CAREER : 'Your confidence is high today, making relations with others a little easier than normal. This is a good time to make calls and get in contact with people that you haven\'t talked to in a while. These relations are vital for future advancements.',
    CATEGORY_LOVE : 'The planetary alignment adds just that little bit of spice to a normally very sweet mix. Although no one would ever accuse you of being manipulative, you tend to get what you want by making others feel so guilty they just give it to you anyway. But you won\'t even need to do that today, as romantically, you can just dive straight in and ask for what you want.',
    CATEGORY_HEALTH : 'Balancing our lives can become a challenge. This is a good time to think about balance where your health is concerned. Is there balance in what you feed your body? Do you expose your system to harmful substances, or are you depriving it of its vital rest? Think along these lines when you plan your days: are you amply providing for your body, thinking about the years you have ahead on this earth? This can be a serious task, but remember it can also be fun. Exercising with a friend is good for the spirit!',
    CATEGORY_FINANCIAL : 'This week the Universe brings up not just a lot of communication but also a lot of busywork. Don\'t be surprised if your week is taken up with filling out forms, filing, and the like. Since it also affects your house of institutions, you\'re solidifying a long-held dream, even if it isn\'t easy in coming. You\'ll grow to like and even appreciate the parts that seem dull, repetitive, tedious, or just plain annoying.',

  {
    'id': HOROSCOPE_LIBRA,
    CATEGORY_GENERAL: 'Some kind of unexpected shakeup could take place today, Libra, and you could find yourself suddenly being offered more money or responsibilities. This might be just the break you\'ve been waiting for, but it could take you so much by surprise that you might ask for time to think about it. Don\'t think for too long, however, because they might give the break to someone else!',
    CATEGORY_CAREER : 'Other people will be willing followers today, so this is a good time to implement one of your new ideas. Feel free to lead the pack. You are the pied piper with a band of people behind you being lured by the music you make. Play louder than usual.',
    CATEGORY_LOVE : 'You may find that a particular date you had been looking forward to for some time proves not to be the passionate encounter you had hoped it would be. The energy emanating from the planets encourages a positive flow of feelings, but this may show itself more in deep conversation rather than amorous embraces. Don\'t abandon hope altogether; tomorrow is another day, and many things could change by then!',
    CATEGORY_HEALTH : 'You used to love physical activity - the more intense the better. What has become of this urge? Picture a big pot filled with soup - the biggest pot you can imagine. Stirring that pot, so that soup from the very bottom mixes with the soup on top, is what exercise does for you. A good balance between aerobic and anaerobic exercise is ideal. This process is not only satisfying physically, but is also necessary for a healthy mind. With so much energy brewing inside of you, regular physical release keeps your mental processes in check. Think about it.',
    CATEGORY_FINANCIAL : 'You have a lot of very supportive energy to build from this week. If you\'ve been considering starting your own business, this is a wonderful time to bring your ideas to life. The emphasis is on structure, so make sure yours is strong. If you aren\'t sure what the first steps should be, consult the abundant information available for small business. If you look to your closest relationships, you\'ll see they had the answers all along.',

    'id': HOROSCOPE_SCORPIO,
    CATEGORY_GENERAL: 'Today you might attend at least one festive social occasion, Scorpio, and therefore you may meet some very interesting people in unusual professions, such as film or TV. Expect to hear some bizarre stories, some of them true, others that are clearly exaggerated. Out of all this friendly banter and tale telling, however, you could acquire some useful information. Make a note of it so you\'ll be able to remember it later.',
    CATEGORY_CAREER : 'A decision you made about two weeks ago is likely to backfire today. Perhaps you were so focused on the details back then that you failed to notice the big picture. Now, this oversight is causing you a great deal of difficulty. Admit your mistakes.',
    CATEGORY_LOVE : 'This is the ideal time to get out and socialize, host a party, or organize virtually anything that brings people together. If you are still looking for the perfect relationship, you may not recognize it immediately, but will get the chance to flirt to your heart\'s content. This way you can get a general idea before making a specific choice.',
    CATEGORY_HEALTH : 'Today\'s energies ignite your spirit. You have the feeling that you can do anything you set your mind to, and this is true! If you could "bottle" all that energy, wouldn\'t it be great? In fact, regular exercise does take that energy directly into your bloodstream, which in turn puts it into your strong muscles. Focus your positive energy on your body and you will see the glowing results. Remember to always drink water after you exercise, to replenish your body\'s vital fluids.',
    CATEGORY_FINANCIAL : 'You have all kinds of beauty coming your way this week. You may be trying to decide whether to beef up your education in money matters or begin to teach others what you already know. Beware of "expert syndrome," where you believe you know everything there is to know. The Universe indicates that your future career success, not to mention your financial success, depends on your ability to be an authority in your field without believing there\'s nothing left to learn.',

    'id': HOROSCOPE_SAGITTARIUS,
    CATEGORY_GENERAL: 'Your level of health and physical well-being is likely to be very high, Sagittarius, and thus you\'re probably glowing. As a result, you might find that those around you pay more attention to what you\'re saying than they usually do. You\'ll also find that your mind is especially sharp, and you\'re apt to be exceptionally quick on the uptake. Therefore, you might absorb a lot more from what you hear than you normally do. Make a note of it!',
    CATEGORY_CAREER : 'People will come around to your side today and realize that your artistic approach is best. Don\'t be afraid to show off your incredible imagination. This quality is not something to hide. It is something to be proud of. You have great power there.',
    CATEGORY_LOVE : 'If you are wishing your relationship situation would improve, know that you have every chance today to make as many changes as you desire. The energy emanating from the planets encourages you to shake off your usual hang-ups, and become a little more easygoing. It is a wonderful time to socialize, so really come to grips with yourself and fit in some serious fun!',
    CATEGORY_HEALTH : 'Do you like going on a Stairmaster when you work out! The motion of the Stairmaster mimics the climbing motion that we miss in our lives when using elevators, escalators and other such devices. During your fitness activities, try to visualize what you are getting out of the exercise both physically and mentally. The time you spend working on your body is precious to the development of your self-esteem. Give yourself a double workout by releasing and strengthening within your mind and heart as well.',
    CATEGORY_FINANCIAL : 'You\'re likely to be cross-pollinating your personal life with your professional contacts this week. The Universe shows you how to seek out the people in any group who can help you advance a product, service, business, or cause. This week look to those born in other countries or those who speak another language. Activity in your money house shows that you may have the creativity but not the true business acumen to make more money now.',

    CATEGORY_GENERAL: 'Today\'s transit encourages you to shower those you love with affection. This is something you may do inwardly all the time, but actually people need physical and verbal appreciation more than you sometimes realize. Use this energy to give yourself the best of everything, too. Have a breakfast with fresh fruit and whole grains, keep the fresh fruits and vegetables coming all day, and have a little protein with one meal. Oh, and, water, water, water! Your energy will glow with this kind of treatment.',
    CATEGORY_CAREER : 'Listen to your intuition today. It knows more than you think it does. Spend some time alone, away from other influences. This time spent will prove to be extremely valuable. The insights that come to you will be tremendously beneficial.',
    CATEGORY_LOVE : 'The energy emanating from the planets may encourage you to go bananas today at parties, gatherings, and social events. Whether you are in a permanent relationship, or looking for one, people will be drawn to you by your magnetic charm and open personality. It will really lift your spirits to connect with so many new people, and many of them may become very good friends.',

    CATEGORY_FINANCIAL : 'You bring a set of fresh eyes to the events of this week with activity in your house of appearances. A friend may have a helpful suggestion about how to earn more money or gain the promotion you\'ve been seeking. Even if you don\'t agree, hear this person out. He or she sees this situation more clearly than you do. You\'re being asked to bring a much more serious side of your personality to work.',

    'id': HOROSCOPE_AQUARIUS,
    CATEGORY_GENERAL: 'An intense dream or vision could result in a spiritual breakthrough of some kind, Aquarius, and you might spend much of the day in a bit of a daze, trying to make sense of it. You might see if you can find a few books on the subject, because all signs suggest that reading could bring a lot of useful information your way today. You might also want to write down an account of your experience.',
    CATEGORY_CAREER : 'Just because you are uncertain of the future doesn\'t mean that you need to be scared of it. Indecision about how to proceed may cripple you today. Remember to act out of faith and not from fear. In this way, you will be led down the path to success.',
    CATEGORY_LOVE : 'If you have been considering how to tell someone just how you feel, you may get a lot of help from the energy emanating from the planets today. It will not only enable you to understand why you feel what you do, but also help you to express yourself more clearly. It would be wise to take advantage of this situation, as it is not going to last forever.',
    CATEGORY_HEALTH : 'You love to explore new ideas, your very own adventures of the mind, and you are greatly assisted by today\'s astral energy. Your idealistic nature tempts you to focus on utopic dreams. You feel this energy as the essence of "possibility," and it will be a period of emotional optimism for you. Whatever you have doubted to be possible in your health or dietary regimen, now is the time to give it a try. It doesn\'t have to be a marathon. Start small, and you can make your dreams a reality!',
    CATEGORY_FINANCIAL : 'This week you\'re being asked to assume more responsibility in your personal or professional relationships. Don\'t just pay them lip service. Go out of your way to make them feel validated. Midweek highlights day-to-day employment. Money may be temporarily unstable, but you\'re getting some great ideas about how to make more. Write them down!',

    'id': HOROSCOPE_PISCES,
    CATEGORY_GENERAL: 'You\'re apt to be in a very joyous mood today, Pisces, and it\'s going to show on your face. This isn\'t going to go unnoticed by the people you meet. You could make some new friends, and, if you aren\'t currently romantically involved, you might actually meet an interesting potential love partner. This person is apt to be very polite and polished, not to mention smart! Be cordial, be nice, and enjoy your day.',
    CATEGORY_CAREER : 'Put some extra finishing touches on your work today. Your tendency may be to get sloppy - especially as the day wears on. Instead, it is important that you completely tie up any loose ends and go the extra mile to impress the people around you.',
    CATEGORY_LOVE : 'The energy emanating from the planets makes this a very sociable day, and especially good for getting out and about, meeting up with people and moving around in different circles. It is not an especially passionate time, although there could be a lot of flirting and meaningful eye contact. It is best to take this opportunity to make new friends and see what transpires from there.',
    CATEGORY_HEALTH : 'Speaking your truth is the beauty of life and relationships, otherwise all beauty is hollow, and life becomes merely a charade. If you feel the tug of certain buried truths, it is wise to welcome them forth with the dedication to making yourself whole. If you feel you need more sleep in order to gear up for the changes you sense afoot, have the courage to say no to an evening out, and get to bed as early as you see fit. No excuses necessary!',
    CATEGORY_FINANCIAL : 'This week life will be anything but boring as your electric personality wins over some but leaves others wondering what planet you came from. You want to go out and play with lovers, mates, or family members, but the Universe wants you to deal with change on the career front. If it\'s starting to cost you way too much, think about how to work from home part time to save on cash spent commuting.',
